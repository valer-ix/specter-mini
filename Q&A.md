- Monitoring alerts must be set up that notify you when the scrapers encounter errors or when 
they're not able to access a website. This can be done using tools such as Prometheus, Grafana,
or ELK stack, which can provide real-time dashboards and alerts for the scraper activity.

- Regular manual checks should be performed to verify that the data being collected by 
the scrapers is accurate and complete. This could involve spot-checking a sample of the data 
against the source website or comparing it to previously collected data to identify any 
discrepancies.

- It's essential to establish a robust testing and quality assurance process (currently totally missing
from this repo) for the scrapers before they are deployed to collect data from a new website. This includes testing 
the scraper's functionality, performance, and accuracy using a range of scenarios and datasets.

- Finally, it's important to have a process in place for handling any issues that arise with 
the scrapers, such as resolving technical issues or adjusting the scraper configuration to 
ensure that it is collecting the required data correctly. Regularly reviewing the logs 
generated by the scrapers and analyzing any errors or issues that arise can help identify 
and fix any problems quickly.

- Keeping rigorous metadata/schemas (e.g. AWS Glue Catalog) can provide valuable information about the data source, 
including its structure, expected data types, and any known issues or limitations, making it 
easier to differentiate between missing data and data that's simply not available.

- Automated data quality checks ought to be implemented in the pipelines themselves (e.g. AWS Glue, Lambdas).

- Use machine learning algorithms: Machine learning algorithms can potentially be trained to 
differentiate between missing data and data that's not available based on patterns
in the data. For example, a machine learning algorithm could be trained to identify 
cases where data is consistently missing for a particular field or where certain 
fields are missing together.

- Scaling should be done via cloud-based infrastructure. Distributed computing frameworks such as 
Apache Hadoop/Spark can be used to parallelize data processing and analysis tasks across multiple nodes, allowing more work to be done within a shorter period of time.

- Optimizing data storage and retrieval can help to reduce the time it takes to scrape and 
process data. This can include using efficient data storage formats such as Parquet or ORC,
using indexing and partitioning to optimize data retrieval, and caching frequently accessed data.

- Implementing data pipeline automation using tools such as AWS Glue can help to streamline 
data processing and analysis tasks.

- The first step is to identify the root cause of the failure. This can involve 
reviewing logs, examining the codebase, and analyzing system behavior to determine 
what caused the feature to fail. Once the root cause of the issue has been identified, a 
fix can be developed and deployed to production (after thorough testing on test/staging stands). This may involve rolling back the 
codebase to a previous version or developing a patch to fix the issue.

- To reduce the likelihood of similar incidents in the future, automated testing should 
be implemented to catch issues before they make it to production. This can involve using 
unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure that all parts of the system 
are functioning correctly. A code review process should also be implemented.
